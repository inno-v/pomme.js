[ ![Codeship Status for radekstepan/samskipti](https://www.codeship.io/projects/ca5d75f0-1243-0131-eb34-7ede9d09110e/status?branch=master)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/7857)

This project builds on the [jschannel](https://github.com/mozilla/jschannel) library, making it safer and allowing for callbacks between frames to happen by way of function serialization.

```bash
$ npm install
$ make [build|watch|test|serve]
